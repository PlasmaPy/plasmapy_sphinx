    RTD Version Flyout solution found in the nextstrain-sphinx-theme
    https://github.com/nextstrain/sphinx-theme

    Implemented PR:
    https://github.com/nextstrain/sphinx-theme/pull/17

    Initiating Issue:
    https://github.com/nextstrain/docs.nextstrain.org/issues/76


    Lie about what theme we really are when some RTD-injected JS fetches the
    full versions panel from the RTD API.  RTD's JS replaces the stub versions
    panel in the Sphinx-generated HTML with the full versions panel it fetches
    from the RTD API.  If the API thinks we're not sphinx_rtd_theme, it will
    serve us the wrong HTML and the panel will float as a "badge" when it
    shouldn't.  As a customized version of sphinx_rtd_theme, we really do want
    the same HTML it gets.  See also the diagnoses in
    <https://github.com/nextstrain/docs.nextstrain.org/issues/76>.

    This bit of JS finds the data RTD injects into the page and modifies it
    before the code that RTD injects runs and looks at the data.  RTD's
    <script>s (in <head>) run before this JS, but they wait until the DOM is
    ready to actually do any work.  This gives us a chance to modify the data
    during DOM load before the RTD code actually uses it.

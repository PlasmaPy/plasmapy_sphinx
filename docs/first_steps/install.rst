Installing with pip
===================

To install the most recent release of `plasmapy_sphinx` on |PyPI| with
|pip| into an existing |Python| |minpython|\ + environment on macOS or
Linux, open a terminal and run:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install plasmapy

On some systems, it might be necessary to specify the |Python| version
number by using ``python3``, ``python3.8``, ``python3.9``,
``python3.10``, or ``python3.11`` instead of ``python``.

To install PlasmaPy on Windows, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   py -3.11 -m pip install plasmapy

The version of |Python| may be changed from ``3.11`` to another supported
Python |minpython|\ + release that has been installed on your computer.

For more detailed information, please refer to this tutorial on
`installing packages`_.

Installing from source code
===========================

Obtaining official releases
---------------------------

A ZIP_ file containing the source code for official releases of
`plasmapy_sphinx` can be obtained `from PyPI`_.

Alternatively, official releases can be downloaded from the releases_
page on the |GitHub repository|.

Obtaining source code from GitHub
---------------------------------

If you have |git| installed on your computer, you may clone the
|Github repository| and access the source code from the most
recent development version by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/PlasmaPy/plasmapy_sphinx.git

The repository will be cloned inside a new subdirectory called
:file:`plasmapy_sphinx`.

If you do not have |git| installed on your computer, then you may
download the most recent source code from |Github repository|
by going to :guilabel:`Code` and selecting :guilabel:`Download ZIP`.
`Unzipping <https://www.wikihow.com/Unzip-a-File>`__ the file will
create a subdirectory called :file:`plasmapy_sphinx` that contains the
source code.

Building and installing
-----------------------

To install the downloaded version of `plasmapy_sphinx`, enter the
:file:`plasmapy_sphinx` directory and run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install .

If you expect to occasionally edit the source code, instead run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e .

The ``-e`` flag makes the installation editable.

.. note::

   If you noticed any places where the installation instructions could
   be improved or have become out of date, please `create an issue`_ on
   |Github repository|. It would really help!

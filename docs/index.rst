`plasmapy_sphinx` is a
`Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__ extension package
that contains custom documentation functionality used to document
`PlasmaPy's packages <https://github.com/PlasmaPy>`_ .  This package is
organized in such a way that users can use all available extensions, or
just a selection of desired ones.

.. note::

    `plasmapy_sphinx` is not currently released in any form and can
    only be installed directly from its `GitHub repository
    <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy_sphinx>`__.  We do plan to
    release it to https://pypi.org but there is no scheduled release
    date at this time.

    Additionally, this package currently has no tests covering its
    functionality.
